# Spark provides this Travis CI configuration file to help contributors
# check Scala/Java style conformance and JDK7/8 compilation easily
# during their preparing pull requests.
#   - Scalastyle is executed during `maven install` implicitly.
#   - Java Checkstyle is executed by `lint-java`.
# See the related discussion here.
